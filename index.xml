      <description>Automatic crash reporting #  In response to several github issues about unexpected crashes I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented crash dump collection. Thanks to SDK provided by Sentry it is fairly easy to integrate Breakpad/Crashpad to collect minidumps for application crashes and send them to developers for investigation.
What is included in crash report #  Crash report provides information about:
 operating system: name, version, architecture Qt version modules that were loaded into klogg process: filename, size and hashes for symbols stacktraces for all running threads in klogg process  These minidumps do not include content of klogg process memory during the crash.</description>

      <title>Version 20.4 released</title>
      <link>https://klogg.filimonov.dev/docs/news/release_20.4/</link>

      <description>Version 20.4 #  During this months there were almost no new commits to klogg. For several years klogg has been my second most frequently used tool (first one being code editor) and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing my best to improve it based on my daily experience and user feedback on github. However, since the beginning of 2020 I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to a more manager-like position. This is all very new to me, and doing this job requires tools not related to log file analysis.</description>
